// Curly braces are used to define the scope of a - of function, variables

// var doesnt work with scope - it is global
// so we need let and const
// both have block level scope
// let can be reassigned
// const cannot be reassigned

// var is function scoped
// let and const are block scoped

// In browser console scope works differently
// window is the global object

// Scope in code env in node application is different
